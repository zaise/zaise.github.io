Graduated in mechatronic engineering, interested in data analysis and artificial intelligence. I have experience using unstructured data for the development of international research projects in the field of AI (USA, Brazil, Japan, Canada). In addition, I have developed classification models in Python brought to production during my internship in Peru. I am always learning and looking for new challenges to improve as a professional.
